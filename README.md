DAO Mad Libs
Description
Make a console/JDBC application where a user can log in with a username and password
and prompt the user for the following inputs at minimum:
• Noun (singular)
• Adjective
• Verb
• Adverb
The program should then output a mad lib using the user inputs in the 'story'. After it runs, the user
should have the option to save the inputs, and when a user logs in, they should be able to see all of the
stories they have saved and replay any previously saved stories.
The content of the story is up to you, and you can have multiple if you want. Here is a sample one to get
you started:
One day, a ______ (singular noun) went to the market to ______ (verb). Noticing the day was
________ (adjective), though, the market closed ______ (adverb).
Filling in the blanks with the noted kinds of words will create a potentially funny story (though maybe
not the above example).
